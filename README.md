How to Start?
If you have an idea of any web projects you want to build just open an appropriate issue regarding this, and we will discuss and assign you that issue. In case you are confused and have queries, just ping me, will help you get along and build!

If you want to contribute by creating new extensions then check the type of your project and add it to its respective folder.
EX: Paint Extensions/files.html
